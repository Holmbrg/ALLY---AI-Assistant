To use program, make sure you have the following set up:

1: Environment variable called "OPENAI_API_KEY" this should contain you openai api key.

2: A google api key in json format in a file named "fabled-gist-429918-k7-3f2dfb1ef283", you'll notice the file I added to the repository has a different file name and contains no api key, this is because, for obvious reasons, I will not pay for anyone to use this program.

3: Make sure the program is downloaded right on to your disk, under "C:"

Extra note; It is possible to run the code using open source methods, i choose not to for quality purposes, and so you don't need a very strong computer to run it.
