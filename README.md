To use program, make sure you have the following set up:

1: Environment variable called "OPENAI_API_KEY" this should contain you openai api key.

2: A google api key in json format in a file named "fabled-gist-429918-k7-3f2dfb1ef283", you'll notice the file I added to the repository has a different file name and contains no api key, this is because, for obvious reasons, I will not pay for anyone to use this program.

3: Make sure the program is downloaded right on to your disk, under "C:"

4: Make sure to double left click each of the AutoHotKey files, or .ahk files, since that activates the shortcut. If it stops working at some point,
a solution will often be, to go back and double left click these files again, sometimes the PC can deactivate the .ahk files.

Shortcuts: Voice assistant; 'ctrl + alt + o', Screen assistant; 'ctrl + alt + p'

The assistants:

The voice assistant is pretty self explanatory, especially when you see the cmd window. Talk to it and it responds, it should guide you, roughly, through how parts of it works.
In regards to, for example, what you have to respond to certain things.

The screen assistant, when activated, checks for any screenshot taken. I personally recommend using the shortcut 'win + shift + s', this allows you to mark exactly the part you want examined.
You can even write in, say, a word document, what you want for it to do, use said shortcut, mark what you want done and it will respond to that specifically.


Extra note; It is possible to run the code using open source methods, i choose not to for quality purposes, and so you don't need a very strong computer to run it.
